When healthy, it’s the vehicle through which environmental pollutants and toxins are eliminated from the body. When not, pores become clogged and the “yucky stuff” stays inside us, where it can build up and wreak havoc.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp class=\"text\"\u003eRegularly dry brushing is so beneficial because it improves the body’s ability to detoxify by clearing away dead skin cells. It also increases blood flow and circulation (the bristles from the brush stimulate your lymphatic system, consequently speeding up the process of waste elimination). And as if that weren’t enough, dry brushing also easily and painlessly reduces the appearance of cellulite and leaves skin looking and feeling younger\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch1 class=\"text\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/h1\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHow to use\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrush before bath or shower by brushing in circular motions, starting at your feet and moving upwards, towards the heart with light pressure\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradually increase the pressure of the dry brushing over time\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrush can be used both wet or dry \u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter use, rinse dry brush clean, shake of excess water and hang to dry outside of your shower\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAfter use, rinse dry brush clean, shake of excess water and hang to dry outside of your shower.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGradually increase the pressure of the dry brushing over time\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Merben International Inc.","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":32471068803127,"sku":"","price":18.0,"currency_code":"CAD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1951\/0465\/products\/NormalSkinBodyDryBrushMerben.png?v=1611018219","url":"https:\/\/www.loveattack.ca\/products\/body-dry-brush-normal-skin-merben","provider":"Boutique Love Attack","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
