<p>Body Dry Brush gently removes dead skin, exfoliates, stimulates circulation, eliminates body toxins and reduces the appearance of cellulite and is suitable for all skin types. <br><meta charset="utf-8"></p>

<h3>Benefits</h3>
<p class="text">Skin is our largest organ. When healthy, it’s the vehicle through which environmental pollutants and toxins are eliminated from the body. When not, pores become clogged and the “yucky stuff” stays inside us, where it can build up and wreak havoc.</p>
<p class="text">Regularly dry brushing is so beneficial because it improves the body’s ability to detoxify by clearing away dead skin cells. It also increases blood flow and circulation (the bristles from the brush stimulate your lymphatic system, consequently speeding up the process of waste elimination). And as if that weren’t enough, dry brushing also easily and painlessly reduces the appearance of cellulite and leaves skin looking and feeling younger</p>
</div>
<ul></ul>
<h3>How to use</h3>
<ul>
<li>Brush before bath or shower by brushing in circular motions, starting at your feet and moving upwards, towards the heart with light pressure</li>
<li>Gradually increase the pressure of the dry brushing over time</li>
<li>Brush can be used both wet or dry </li>
<li>After use, rinse dry brush clean, shake of excess water and hang to dry outside of your shower</li>
