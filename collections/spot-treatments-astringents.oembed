This gentle astringent is derived from a honoured formula, developed by Thayers to cleanse, tone, moisturize, and balance the pH level of skin. In addition to containing certified organic Aloe Vera, this unique, proprietary blend also contains certified organic, non-distilled Witch Hazel that’s grown exclusively for Thayers on a family farm in Fairfield County, Connecticut. By avoiding distillation of our Witch Hazel, we’re able to preserve the naturally-occurring, beneficial tannins, which are known to offer antioxidant and antibacterial benefits, and bring about a natural glow. Thayers elixirs have been a fixture in medicine cabinets for generations – once you use them, you’ll know why.\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eParaben-Free • Phthalate-Free • Gluten-Free\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e12 oz. bottle\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIngredients\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePurified  Water,  SD Alcohol 40-B (Natural Grain), Glycerin (Vegetable), Natural Fragrance, Certified Organic Witch Hazel Ext Blend  (Hamamelis virginiana Extract (Witch Hazel*), Aloe barbadensis Leaf Juice (Filet of Aloe Vera*)), Phenoxyethanol\u003cbr\u003e* Denotes Certified Organic Ingredients\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eDirections\u003c\/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e Apply with a cotton ball or soft pad to cleanse, soften, refresh and moisturize skin.
