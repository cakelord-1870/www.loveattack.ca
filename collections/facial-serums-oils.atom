<h3>How to use</h3>
<p>Always make sure the serum is shaken well before applying so that all the key ingredients are present in each application.</p>
<p>After cleansing with the Skin Essence Organics Pure or Fresh facial cleanser, massage the Ocular eye serum into the skin around the eye bone for approximately 10 to 20 seconds. This will ensure deep absorption of the ingredients.</p>
<p>Wait approximately 5 minutes for full absorption of the formula before applying any makeup over top.</p>
<p>Tip: The special dropper cap used on this product carefully controls how much is released and stops the dirt and air from entering into the package, keeping it fresh. To easily release one drop at a time, simply hold the bottle upside down and “tap” the bottom of the bottle with your finger.</p>

<h3>How to use</h3>

<p>To ensure deep absorption, massage the serums into the skin thoroughly.</p>
<p>*Tip- After cleansing your skin and before applying the serum, splash your face with cool water. This will help to close your skin’s pores and the water on the face will also allow the serum to spread easily and evenly. Water also has a natural capillary action, which will help to pull the vitamins and minerals into your skin, leaving a healthy glow! (Each serum takes about 5 minutes to fully absorb)</p>
<p>Prefer a lighter hydration? Simply add a couple of drops of water to 1-2 pumps of this moisturizing serum on the palm of your hand, before applying to your face. The more water you add, the lighter the hydration will be. Our oil-based moisturizers are fully customizable to help you get the right hydration for your skin and the weather changes.</p>
<p>For optimum freshness, use within 6 months of opening.</p>

</h3>

<p>To ensure deep absorption, massage into the skin thoroughly.</p>

This will help to close your skin’s pores and the water on the face will also allow the serum to spread easily and evenly. Water also has a natural capillary action, which will help to pull the vitamins and minerals into your skin, leaving a healthy glow! (Each serum takes about 5 minutes to fully absorb)</p>
<p>Prefer a lighter hydration? Simply add a couple of drops of water to 1-2 pumps of this moisturizing serum on the palm of your hand, before applying to your face. The more water you add, the lighter the hydration will be.<br>Our oil-based moisturizers are fully customizable to help you get the right hydration for your skin and the weather changes.</p>
